# The Evaluator module provides some classes and methods to construct 
# classes for evaluating the performance of a model against a dataset.  
# Different evaluators measure different kinds of performance.  
#
# Evaluators are classes which provide the methods:
# * add_result(actual, prediction), called for every instance during evaluation
# * value, to retrieve a measure of performance
# * better_than?(evaluator), to compare performance between two evaluators

  # correctly classified out of all the available instances.
